#Change Log

Change log v.0.3.1

**fix**: a very rare issue was found in the 404.html and 500.html handlers which caused unformatted error messages (as if the 404.html or 500.html files didn't exist). this is now fixed.

**feature removed**: (Code Breaker), removed the `Anorexic.default_content_type` feature. it's prone to issues.

**fix**: the send_data method now sets the content-type that was set by the caller (was sending 'application/pdf' for some historic testing reason).

**patched**: utf-8 encoding enforcement now works. this might disrupt non-text web-apps (which should use `Anorexic.default_encoding = 'binary'` or `Anorexic.default_encoding = false`).

**feature**: Enabled path rewrites to effect router - see the advanced features in the wiki home for how to apply this powerful feature. Notice that re-writing is done using the `env["PATH_INFO"]` or the `request.path_info=` method - the `request.path` method is a read only method.

Change log v.0.3.0

This release breaks old code!

Re-written the RackServer class and moved more logic to middleware (request re-encoding, static file serving, index file serving, 404 error handling and exception handling are now done through middleware).

Proc safety feature is discarded for now - if you use `return` within a dynamic Ruby Proc, you WILL get an exception - just like Ruby intended you to.

File services can now be set up only through the listen call and directory listing is off *(I'm thinking of writing my own middleware for that, as the Rack::Directory seems to break apart or maybe I don't understand how to use it).

so, code that looked like this:

```
listen

# routes

route '*', file_root: File.expand_path(File.join(Dir.pwd, 'public'))
```

should now look like this:

```
listen root: file_root: File.expand_path(File.join(Dir.pwd, 'public'))

# routes
```

fix: Static file services

fix, update: I18n support

fix: ActiveRecord Tasks

update: Haml support

Change log v.0.2.1

Updated some SSL features so that Thin SSL is initialized.

Support for SSL features is still very basic, as there isn't much documentation and each server handles the initialization somewhat differently (at times extremely differently).

some minor bug fixes.

Change log v.0.2.0

First release that actually works well enough to do something with.
