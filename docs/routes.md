# Plezi's Smart Routing System

In the core of Plezi's framework is a smart Object Oriented Router which actls like a "virtual folder" with RESTful routing and Websocket support.

RESTful routing and Websocket callback support both allow us to use conventionally named methods in our Controller to achive common tasks. Such names methods, as will be explored further on, include the `update`, `save` and `show` RESTful method names, as well as the `on_open`, `on_message(data)` and `on_close` Websocket callbacks.
