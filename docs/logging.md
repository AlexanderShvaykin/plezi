# Plezi's Logging

(todo: write documentation)

Inside Plezi's core code is a pure Ruby IO reactor called [GReactor](https://github.com/boazsegev/GReactor) (Generic Reactor), a very powerful Asynchronous Workflow Engine that allows us to enjoy both Multi-Threading and Multi-Processing.

Plezi leverage's [GReactor's](https://github.com/boazsegev/GReactor) logging support to help you log to both files and STDOUT (terminal screen) - either one or both

You can read more about [GReactor](https://github.com/boazsegev/GReactor) and it's amazing features in it's [documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/boazsegev/GReactor/master).
